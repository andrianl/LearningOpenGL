# OpenGL Study Project

## Description

This project is a personal educational endeavor, inspired by a series of instructional resources on OpenGL.  
It is designed to document the learning process as I explore the intricacies of OpenGL, demonstrating acquired knowledge through practical experiments and rendering techniques.

⚠️ **Note:** The code is currently in a rough and unoptimized state. This repository exists purely for learning purposes.  
A complete refactor and cleanup will be done in the future once the core concepts are fully understood.

## Learning Resources

- [The OpenGL video series by The Cherno](https://youtu.be/W3gAzLwfIP0?si=prz5AUEP3mS8u6Ty)  
- [LearnOpenGL — an excellent written guide](https://learnopengl.com/)

## Build

This project uses **Premake** for its build configuration.  
To generate the Visual Studio 2022 project files, ensure that Premake is installed and available at the following path on your system: C:\Path\premake\premake5.exe

Once Premake is installed at this location, you can generate the Visual Studio 2022 project files by running the `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` batch file included in the repository.

> **Note:** In future updates, this process will be improved to work across different IDEs and operating systems without requiring manual setup.

## Screenshots
