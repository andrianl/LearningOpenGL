# OpenGL Study Project

## Description

This project is a personal educational endeavor, inspired by a series of instructional YouTube videos on OpenGL. It's designed to document the learning experience as I delve into the intricacies of OpenGL, demonstrating the acquired knowledge through practical application and rendering techniques.

The video series offers a structured approach to understanding OpenGL and serves as a guide for the various experiments and examples contained within this repository.

## Build

This project uses Premake for its build configuration. To generate the Visual Studio 2022 project files, ensure that Premake is installed and available at the following path on your system: C:\Path\premake\premake5.exe
Once Premake is installed at this location, you can generate the Visual Studio 2022 project files by running the GenerateProjectFiles.bat batch file included in the repository.

Note: In future updates, this process will be improved to work across different IDEs and operating systems without requiring manual setup.
